## 1. Information We Collect

### Financial Tracking Data (Stored Locally)

When you use FinNest to track your ISA contributions, you may enter:

- ISA contribution amounts
- Contribution dates
- ISA provider names
- ISA account types

This data is stored locally on your device. FinNest cannot access, retrieve, or delete this information on your behalf. You control this data directly within the app.

### Device Information

We may collect device type, operating system version, and app version for analytics purposes only.

### Registered User Accounts

If you create a FinNest account, we may collect:

- Email address and login credentials
- Financial tracking data associated with your account

This data is stored securely on our servers and used only to provide features such as saving and syncing data across devices.

### Future Optional Integrations

If you choose to connect external services (such as ISA providers), we will only access and use that information with your explicit consent and solely to provide features you request.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide and operate the FinNest service
- Calculate ISA allowances and contributions
- Display your contribution history
- Improve our app and fix bugs
- Provide customer support

We process personal data based on your consent, our legitimate interest in operating and improving the app, and to comply with legal obligations where applicable.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage

Financial tracking data (ISA contributions, amounts, dates) for guest users is stored locally on your device. It will be lost if you delete the app or reset your device.

### Server Storage

For registered users, account and financial tracking data is stored securely on our servers with encryption and access controls.

### Security Measures

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data. Where data is transmitted (such as analytics or optional integrations), it is encrypted in transit.

## 4. Your Rights

You have the following rights regarding your personal information:

- **Right of Access** – Request a copy of your data
- **Right to Rectification** – Correct inaccurate information
- **Right to Erasure** – Request deletion of your data

- **Right to Object** – Object to certain processing activities
- **Right to Lodge a Complaint** – Contact the ICO

**Note:** For data stored only on your device, you may need to manage or delete it directly in the app. Registered users may request deletion of account data through the app or by contacting us.

## 5. Data Sharing

We may share limited data with trusted third-party service providers who assist us with analytics, hosting, authentication, or app performance monitoring.

We will never sell, rent, or trade your personal information for marketing purposes.

### Future Optional Integrations

Any connection to external financial services will only occur with your explicit consent, and you may revoke access at any time.

## 6. Children's Privacy

FinNest is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
